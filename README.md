# Worm Game by Nailbar (nailbar.io)

This is a rewrite of my first "real" game I made in C++ back in 2004, when I was learning programming.
This version uses the same design, logic, and rules as the original one with the main difference being this one is not limited to 640 x 480 pixels.
See file nwn105_main.cpp for original source (it's horrible).

Slim worm controls: A, S, D.
Fat worm controls: J, K, L or arrow keys left, down, right.

Inactivity for 5 seconds gives control back to the computer.
Take control of a worm to dismiss this message.
